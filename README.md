This was a project with goal of implementing a data structure as well as the creation of my AI `MohDar13`. The goal of my AI was to beat any AI it was against. This was done with a number of significant algorithms. The main algorithm was one that would calculate both the enemy's and mine shortest path. With this data the AI would decide whether to place a wall or to move. The AI would move if its shortest path was shorter than its opposites. If the AI had a longer path then it would place a wall to prevent the opposites path. This creating an AI that would adapt to its conditions and act accordingly.

My tutorial on how to install and test my AI can be found @ http://daraghmeh.github.io/Quoridor
